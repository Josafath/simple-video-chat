## How this project works ? 
Using socket.io, WebRTC API (no libraries) and Passport for authenticate users you can connect with someone creating a room or joining one  of your friends.
I try to make this project like if it was a real product.


### Pd:
This was the hardest project that I made, I've never been in a situation where I could feel many confusion and frustration for not knowing but then everything pays off.
If someone wants to collaborate of you have some thoughts of how I can improve this, send me an email. :)
This is the the link to the project:
