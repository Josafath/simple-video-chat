A lightweight, real-time video chat application built using WebRTC and Socket.IO. This project demonstrates the core functionality needed for peer-to-peer video and audio communication, making it a great starting point for more advanced implementations.

### Features
- Peer-to-peer video and audio communication using WebRTC.
- Real-time signaling powered by Socket.IO.
- Clean and minimal user interface for easy interaction.

### Pd:
This was the hardest project that I made, I've never been in a situation where I could feel many confusion and frustration for not knowing but then everything pays off.
If someone wants to collaborate of you have some thoughts of how I can improve this, send me an email. :)
If you wanna use this projects you will have to have this little things in mind.
